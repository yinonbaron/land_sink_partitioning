# Code for the analysis in the paper `Recent gains in global terrestrial carbon stocks are mostly stored in non-living pool`

All data to support the findings of the study are publicly available and could be downloaded using the `00a_download_data.ipynb` notebook. The only data not publicly available is the L-VOD biomass data, which could be received through a request to the authors.

The code was tested on pyhton 3.11.9
To run the code, first set up a new python environment with using the `requirements.txt` file:


```
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements
```

Then you can run the scripts in consecutive order to produce the results and figures.
